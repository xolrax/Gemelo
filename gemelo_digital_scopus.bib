	abstract = {Featured Application: This study covered a pathological staging and biochemical recurrence prediction method using machine learning to design a prostate cancer process based on a digital twin. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) enable users to make decisions based on clinical data from electronic medical records, facilitating personalized precision medicine treatments. A digital twin (DT) approach enables the interoperability between physical and virtual environments through data analysis using machine learning (ML). By combining DT with the prostate cancer (PCa) process, it is possible to predict cancer prognosis. In this study, we propose a DT-based prediction model for clinical decision-making in the PCa process. Pathology and biochemical recurrence (BCR) were predicted with ML using data from a clinical data warehouse and the PCa process. The DT model was developed using data from 404 patients. The BCR prediction accuracy increased according to the amount of data used, and reached as high as 96.25% when all data were used. The proposed DT-based predictive model can help provide a clinical decision support system for PCa. Further, it can be used to improve medical processes, promote health, and reduce medical costs and problems. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disease with multiple underlying influences and notable heterogeneity among its clinical and response-to-treatment phenotypes. There is no cure for IBD, and none of the currently available therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacies beyond 40%–60%. Data collected about its omics, pathogenesis, and treatment strategies have grown exponentially with time making IBD a prime candidate for artificial intelligence (AI) mediated discovery support. AI can be leveraged to further understand or identify IBD features to improve clinical outcomes. Various treatment candidates are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, offering further approaches and opportunities for increasing the efficacies of treatments. However, currently, therapeutic plans are largely determined using clinical features due to the lack of specific biomarkers, and it has become necessary to step into precision medicine to predict therapeutic responses to guarantee optimal treatment efficacy. This is accompanied by the application of AI and the development of multiscale hybrid models combining mechanistic approaches and machine learning. These models ultimately lead to the creation of digital twins of given patients delivering on the promise of precision dosing and tailored treatment. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a prominent cytokine in cell-to-cell communication in the inflammatory responses’ regulation. Dysregulated IL-6-induced signaling leads to severe immunological or proliferative pathologies, such as IBD and colon cancer. This mini-review explores multiscale models with the aim of predicting the response to therapy in IBD. Modeling IL-6 biology and generating digital twins enhance the credibility of their prediction. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after prostate cancer radiotherapy is crucial for devising personalised treatments. BCR has been traditionally predicted using clinical data or in vivo imaging within AI frameworks such as radiomics approaches, but with limited results and reduced interpretability. These analysis are additionally hindered by the imbalanced and heterogeneous nature of data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to predict BCR at 5 years, based not only on clinical and image features, but also on a patient specific radiobiological mechanistic in silico model simulating tumour growth and radiation response. By combining all these data, we aim at i) improving the prediction of BCR after prostate cancer radiotherapy (RT), and ii) bringing interpretability to this prediction. A cohort of 254 patients was used. Pre-treatment T2-w MRIs, ADC maps and 7 clinicopathological characteristics were available. Patient specific digital twins of tumours were created from MRIs. The prescribed treatment was simulated with the mechanistic model yielding 414 features characterising the response of the tumour to RT. A first univariate feature selection analysis was conducted to select the most predictive features. Then, a machine learning algorithm was trained using selected features and compared with a deep learning (DL) approach based on clinicopathological characteristics and MRIs. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.74 by training a random forest classifier combining most predictive features. The DL model achieved an AUC of 0.69. This methodology opens the road to interpretability of the response to radiotherapy and tailored treatments for prostate cancer patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Currently, selection of patients for sequential versus concurrent chemotherapy and radiation regimens lacks evidentiary support and it is based on locally optimal decisions for each step. Objective: We aim to optimize the multistep treatment of patients with head and neck cancer and predict multiple patient survival and toxicity outcomes, and we develop, apply, and evaluate a first application of deep Q-learning (DQL) and simulation to this problem. Methods: The treatment decision DQL digital twin and the patient's digital twin were created, trained, and evaluated on a data set of 536 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with the goal of, respectively, determining the optimal treatment decisions with respect to survival and toxicity metrics and predicting the outcomes of the optimal treatment on the patient. Of the data set of 536 patients, the models were trained on a subset of 402 (75%) patients (split randomly) and evaluated on a separate set of 134 (25%) patients. Training and evaluation of the digital twin dyad was completed in August 2020. The data set includes 3-step sequential treatment decisions and complete relevant history of the patient cohort treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2005 and 2013, with radiomics analysis performed for the segmented primary tumor volumes. Results: On the test set, we found mean 87.35% (SD 11.15%) and median 90.85% (IQR 13.56%) accuracies in treatment outcome prediction, matching the clinicians' outcomes and improving the (predicted) survival rate by +3.73% (95% CI -0.75% to 8.96%) and the dysphagia rate by +0.75% (95% CI -4.48% to 6.72%) when following DQL treatment decisions. Conclusions: Given the prediction accuracy and predicted improvement regarding the medically relevant outcomes yielded by this approach, this digital twin dyad of the patient-physician dynamic treatment problem has the potential of aiding physicians in determining the optimal course of treatment and in assessing its outcomes. © Elisa Tardini, Xinhua Zhang, Guadalupe Canahuate, Andrew Wentzel, Abdallah S R Mohamed, Lisanne Van Dijk, Clifton D Fuller, G Elisabeta Marai},

In the radiotherapy decision-making, the whole genetic information and biological characteristics of tumors and individuals can be obtained through the methods of omics technology. For the determination of radiotherapy targets, through the image technique it provides the full genetics and microenvironmental information of the cancer lesion. For treatment response evaluation and follow-up, it can timely optimize the radiotherapy plan and monitor the tumor by realtime dynamic observation of changes in various histological information throughout the treatment process. The advantages of the treatment model are reflected in accurate decision-making, avoiding "blind people's touch" and partial errors.

	abstract = {A digital twin (DT) is a three-part idea, which includes a virtual counterpart, a physical model, and the interaction between the two. This intersection of medicine and computer science represents a new area with numerous possible applications. DT technology can evaluate the correlations between a physical cancer patient and a comparable digital counterpart to isolate predictors of disease. DT can be created in healthcare for both patients and the disease risk assessment and therapy process, and they can be used to inform quantitatively adaptive risk assessment, diagnosis, and therapy decision-making, as well as personalization and optimization of health outcomes, prediction and prevention of adverse events, and intervention planning. In an ideal world, the DT concept may be used to patients to enhance diagnoses and therapy. The goal is to (1) create an unlimited number of replicas of network models of all phenotypic, molecular, and environmental factors related to disease mechanisms in individual patients; (2) computationally treat those DTs with thousands of drugs to find the best-performing drug; and (3) treat the patient with this drug and observe the side effects. To address multistage risk assessment and therapy selection models, which include both related disease and side-effect considerations in which a digital replica or DT of a physical process or entity is virtually recreated, with similar elements and dynamics, to achieve real-time optimization and testing, is used. This chapter presents the notion that data science may supplement clinical expertise to scientifically guide disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. In particular, digital twins could forecast disease obstacles by using them in precision medicine, disease care and treatment modeling, machine learning, and predictive analytics and combining distinct scales of clinician viewpoints. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Cancer is a dangerous ailment that influences any part of the body and could produce malignant tumors. One feature of cancer is that abnormal cells create quickly and expand beyond their regular bounds. This could attack various parts of the human body and spread to other organs, which is the primary cause of cancer death. Cancer is becoming a more serious worldwide health concern. In the face of these threats, advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cognitive systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT) may be insufficient to prevent, predict, diagnose, and treat cancer. Digital Twins (DT) with a combination of IoT, AI, cloud computing, and communications technologies such as 5G and 6G have the potential to significant reduce serious cancer threats. Observing data from DT populations may aid in the improvement of some cancer screening, prediction, prevention, detection, treatment, and research investment strategies. Applications of DT medicine specifically cancer, have been studied and analyzed in this paper using both conceptual and statistical analyses. This paper also shows a tree of some ailments where DT is applicable in their study. To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature research on various illnesses and DT specifically cancer disorders. To show the potential of DT, development hurdles of utilizing DT in cancer diseases are discussed, and then, several open research directions will be explained.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The concept of a digital twin came from the engineering, industrial, and manufacturing domains to create virtual objects or machines that could inform the design and development of real objects. This idea is appealing for precision medicine where digital twins of patients could help inform healthcare decisions. We have developed a methodology for generating and using digital twins for clinical outcome prediction. We introduce a new approach that combines synthetic data and network science to create digital twins (i.e. SynTwin) for precision medicine. First, our approach starts by estimating the distance between all subjects based on their available features. Second, the distances are used to construct a network with subjects as nodes and edges defining distance less than the percolation threshold. Third, communities or cliques of subjects are defined. Fourth, a large population of synthetic patients are generated using a synthetic data generation algorithm that models the correlation structure of the data to generate new patients. Fifth, digital twins are selected from the synthetic patient population that are within a given distance defining a subject community in the network. Finally, we compare and contrast community-based prediction of clinical endpoints using real subjects, digital twins, or both within and outside of the community. Key to this approach are the digital twins defined using patient similarity that represent hypothetical unobserved patients with patterns similar to nearby real patients as defined by network distance and community structure. We apply our SynTwin approach to predicting mortality in a population-based cancer registry (n=87,674) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from the National Cancer Institute (USA). Our results demonstrate that nearest network neighbor prediction of mortality in this study is significantly improved with digital twins (AUROC=0.864, 95% CI=0.857-0.872) over just using real data alone (AUROC=0.791, 95% CI=0.781-0.800). These results suggest a network-based digital twin strategy using synthetic patients may add value to precision medicine efforts.  © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Digital twins are made of a real-world component where data is measured and a virtual component where those measurements are used to parameterize computational models. There is growing interest in applying digital twins-based approaches to optimize personalized treatment plans and improve health outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence is critical in this process, as it enables the development of sophisticated disease models that can accurately predict patient response to therapeutic interventions. There is a unique and equally important application of AI to the real-world component of a digital twin when it is applied to medical interventions. The patient can only be treated once, and therefore, we must turn to the experience and outcomes of previously treated patients for validation and optimization of the computational predictions. The physical component of a digital twins instead must utilize a compilation of available data from previously treated cancer patients whose characteristics (genetics, tumor type, lifestyle, etc.) closely parallel those of a newly diagnosed cancer patient for the purpose of predicting outcomes, stratifying treatment options, predicting responses to treatment and/or adverse events. These tasks include the development of robust data collection methods, ensuring data availability, creating precise and dependable models, and establishing ethical guidelines for the use and sharing of data. To successfully implement digital twin technology in clinical care, it is crucial to gather data that accurately reflects the variety of diseases and the diversity of the population.

	abstract = {Constructing digital twins for predictive tumor treatment response models can have a high computational demand that presents a practical barrier for their clinical adoption. In this work, we demonstrate that proper orthogonal decomposition, by which a low-dimensional representation of the full model is constructed, can be used to dramatically reduce the computational time required to calibrate a partial differential equation model to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for rapid predictions of tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. In the proposed formulation, the reduction basis is based on each patient's own MRI data and controls the overall size of the “reduced order model”. Using the full model as the reference, we validate that the reduced order mathematical model can accurately predict response in 50 triple negative breast cancer patients receiving standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The concordance correlation coefficient between the full and reduced order models was 0.986 ± 0.012 (mean ± standard deviation) for predicting changes in both tumor volume and cellularity across the entire model family, with a corresponding median local error (inter-quartile range) of 4.36 % (1.22 %, 15.04 %). The total time to estimate parameters and to predict response dramatically improves with the reduced framework. Specifically, the reduced order model accelerates our calibration by a factor of (mean ± standard deviation) 378.4 ± 279.8 when compared to the full order model for a non-mechanically coupled model. This enormous reduction in computational time can directly help realize the practical construction of digital twins when the access to computational resources is limited. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We are rapidly approaching a future in which cancer patient digital twins will reach their potential to predict cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients. This will be realized based on advances in high performance computing, computational modeling, and an expanding repertoire of observational data across multiple scales and modalities. In 2020, the US National Cancer Institute, and the US Department of Energy, through a trans-disciplinary research community at the intersection of advanced computing and cancer research, initiated team science collaborative projects to explore the development and implementation of predictive Cancer Patient Digital Twins. Several diverse pilot projects were launched to provide key insights into important features of this emerging landscape and to determine the requirements for the development and adoption of cancer patient digital twins. Projects included exploring approaches to using a large cohort of digital twins to perform deep phenotyping and plan treatments at the individual level, prototyping self-learning digital twin platforms, using adaptive digital twin approaches to monitor treatment response and resistance, developing methods to integrate and fuse data and observations across multiple scales, and personalizing treatment based on cancer type. Collectively these efforts have yielded increased insights into the opportunities and challenges facing cancer patient digital twin approaches and helped define a path forward. Given the rapidly growing interest in patient digital twins, this manuscript provides a valuable early progress report of several CPDT pilot projects commenced in common, their overall aims, early progress, lessons learned and future directions that will increasingly involve the broader research community. 2022 Stahlberg, Abdel-Rahman, Aguilar, Asadpoure, Beckman, Borkon, Bryan, Cebulla, Chang, Chatterjee, Deng, Dolatshahi, Gevaert, Greenspan, Hao, Hernandez-Boussard, Jackson, Kuijjer, Lee, Macklin, Madhavan, McCoy, Mohammed Mirzaei, Razzaghi, Rocha, Shahriyari, Shmulevich, Stover, Sun, Syeda-Mahmood, Wang, Wang and Zervantonakis.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling in oncology has a long history. Recently, mathematical models and their predictions have made inroads into prospective clinical trials with encouraging results. The goal of many such modeling efforts is to make predictions, either to clinician's choice therapy or into “optimal” therapy – often for individual patients. The mathematical oncology community rightfully puts great hope into predictive modeling and mechanistic digital twins – but with this great opportunity comes great responsibility. Mathematical models need to be rigorously calibrated and validated, and their predictive performance ascertained, before conclusions about predictions into the unknown can be drawn. The recent article “Modeling tumor growth using fractal calculus: Insights into tumor dynamics” (Golmankhaneh et al., 2023), applied fractal calculus to tumor growth data.

	abstract = {Effective screening is essential to reducing CRC incidence and mortality by detecting the disease at early stages and identifying non-invasive precursors. While colonoscopy remains the most sensitive modality to visualize and remove neoplastic lesions thereby reducing CRC and the related death, its high cost and invasive nature limit its widespread use. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which offers a non-invasive alternative with higher public acceptance and comparable cost-effectiveness to colonoscopy, has become the preferred screening method in many regions. Newer non-invasive tests, such as multitarget stool DNA or RNA tests, have shown improved sensitivity for CRC and advanced adenomas, although their high costs and lower specificity present challenges for large-scale implementation. Blood-based circulating cell-free DNA test also offer promise but still require optimization to be cost-effective. The heterogeneity of the screening population further complicates the effectiveness of CRC screening programs. Variations in non-communicable disease risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome, lifestyle habits, and comorbidities, can significantly influence CRC risk and screening outcomes. Moreover, diverse screening behaviors, including inconsistent adherence to recommended screening intervals and the interchangeable use of different screening modalities, add complexity to achieving uniform effectiveness across populations. This variability underscores the need for personalized screening strategies that consider individual risk profiles and screening behaviors, as well as the application of cutting-edge technologies such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and digital twin approaches to evaluate its effectiveness. This article reviews the current CRC screening strategies, the advantages of non-invasive methods, and the potential of fecal hemoglobin concentration, to tailor screening intervals and improve risk stratification. It also discusses the emerging role of real-world data and advanced technologies in enhancing CRC screening accuracy and effectiveness, particularly in complex real-world scenarios where traditional methods may fall short. Before novel non-invasive approaches, such as ctDNA tests or polygenic risk scores, are validated and proven cost-effective, exploring the clinical utility of FIT and its quantitative measurement in both screening and surveillance by integrating real-world clinical big data seems a feasible direction for achieving sustained development in population screening. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in researching and developing personalized medical AI services. The previous AI medical systems rarely provided model output compared to multiple datasets and AI models. Currently, only few medical AI systems offer integrated platforms for multidisciplinary precision medicine services. Most existing medical AI systems include AI prognosis with a singular discipline in focus, such as elderly healthcare. This paper proposes a novel digital twin-based integrated precision medicine web-services platform. Our proposed system architecture can be easily implemented in hospital organization interfaces because of the ensured platform independence. Based on the prognostic requirements, we design the service interface with a broad spectrum of patient medical parameter selection (survival time, vital signs, etc.) made available for each medical service. The data related to each patient can be effortlessly updated in real-time. The services will predict and evaluate the accuracy of the visualized output along with the patient clinical information. To verify the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we implemented it with different AI medical services, such as 5 year lung cancer survival prediction, survival analysis with lung tumor segmentation and rapid response analysis. We observed that the architecture showed excellent performance. The architecture for this comprehensive precision medicine web-service platform (Comp-Med) is highly efficient and flexible. It is easily extensible to the new features, services, and updates that may get accommodated in the future.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Healthcare technologies have seen a surge in utilization during the COVID 19 pandemic. Remote patient care, virtual follow-up and other forms of futurism will likely see further adaptation both as a preparational strategy for future pandemics and due to the inevitable evolution of artificial intelligence. This manuscript theorizes the healthcare applications of digital twin technology. Digital twin is a triune concept that involves a physical model, a virtual counterpart, and the interplay between the two constructs. This interface between computer science and medicine is a new frontier with broad potential applications. We propose that digital twin technology can exhaustively and methodologically analyze the associations between a physical cancer patient and a corresponding digital counterpart with the goal of isolating predictors of neurological sequalae of disease. This proposition stems from the premise that data science can complement clinical acumen to scientifically inform the diagnostics, treatment planning and prognostication of cancer care. Specifically, digital twin could predict neurological complications through its utilization in precision medicine, modelling cancer care and treatment, predictive analytics and machine learning, and in consolidating various spectra of clinician opinions.

	abstract = {Introduction Patients with advanced cancer frequently suffer from chronic, severe disabling pain. Opioids such as morphine and fentanyl are commonly used to manage this pain. Transdermal drug delivery systems are important technologies for administering drugs in a non-invasive, continuous and controlled manner. Due to the narrow therapeutic range of fentanyl, individualised dosing is essential to avoid underdosing or overdosing. Standard clinical calculation tools for opioid rotation however do not include important patient characteristics that account for interindividual variability of opioid pharmacology. Methods and analysis We developed a clinical protocol to optimise individual fentanyl dosing in patients with advanced cancer switching from oral or intravenous opioids to transdermal fentanyl by using a physics-based digital twin (DT) that is fed by important clinical and physiological parameters. Individual tailoring of transdermal fentanyl therapy is an approach with the potential for personalised and effective care with an improved benefit-risk ratio. However, clinical validation of physics-based digital twins (PBDT) dosing is crucial to proving clinical benefit. Therapeutic drug monitoring will allow to validate the accuracy of PBDT predictions. Additional monitoring for breathing dynamics, sequential pain levels and fentanyl-related adverse events will contribute to evaluating the performance of PBDT-based dosing of transdermal fentanyl. The primary objective of the study is to develop an experimental protocol to validate DT-guided fentanyl dosing in patients with advanced cancer. This clinical study will bring individualised opioid dosing closer to clinical practice. Ethics and dissemination Study documents have been approved by the responsible Ethics Committee and study initiation is planned for late summer 2024. Data will be shared with the scientific community no more than 1 year following completion of the study and data assembly. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.},

The suitability of the patient's condition to carry on with the ongoing therapy is monitored periodically and bootstraps the whole preparation of a new iteration of the treatment. This makes pharmaceutical supply chain management very difficult to optimise since it needs to be responsive to sudden change while efficient in terms of costs and usage of resources.

	abstract = {Purpose Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common subtype of lung cancer. Patient survival prediction using machine learning (ML) and radiomics analysis proved to provide promising outcomes. However, most studies reported in the literature focused on information extracted from malignant lesions. This study aims to explore the relevance and additional value of information extracted from healthy organs in addition to tumoral tissue using ML algorithms. Patients and Methods This study included PET/CT images of 154 patients collected from available online databases. The gross tumor volume and 33 volumes of interest defined on healthy organs were segmented using nnU-Net deep learning-based segmentation. Subsequently, 107 radiomic features were extracted from PET and CT images (Organomics). Clinical information was combined with PET and CT radiomics from organs and gross tumor volumes considering 19 different combinations of inputs. Finally, different feature selection (FS; 5 methods) and ML (6 algorithms) algorithms were tested in a 3-fold data split cross-validation scheme. The performance of the models was quantified in terms of the concordance index (C-index) metric. Results For an input combination of all radiomics information, most of the selected features belonged to PET Organomics and CT Organomics. The highest C-index (0.68) was achieved using univariate C-index FS method and random survival forest ML model using CT Organomics + PET Organomics as input as well as minimum depth FS method and CoxPH ML model using PET Organomics as input. Considering all 17 combinations with C-index higher than 0.65, Organomics from PET or CT images were used as input in 16 of them. Conclusions The selected features and C-indices demonstrated that the additional information extracted from healthy organs of both PET and CT imaging modalities improved the ML performance. Organomics could be a step toward exploiting the whole information available from multimodality medical images, contributing to the emerging field of digital twins in health care.

This emerging field finds increasing applications in (mathematical) oncology. This review aims to capture the current state of the field and provides a perspective on how mechanistic learning may progress in the oncology domain. We highlight the synergistic potential of mechanistic learning and point out similarities and differences between purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches concerning model complexity, data requirements, outputs generated, and interpretability of the algorithms and their results. Four categories of mechanistic learning (sequential, parallel, extrinsic, intrinsic) of mechanistic learning are presented with specific examples. We discuss a range of techniques including physics-informed neural networks, surrogate model learning, and digital twins. Example applications address complex problems predominantly from the domain of oncology research such as longitudinal tumor response predictions or time-to-event modeling. As the field of mechanistic learning advances, we aim for this review and proposed categorization framework to foster additional collaboration between the data- and knowledge-driven modeling fields. Further collaboration will help address difficult issues in oncology such as limited data availability, requirements of model transparency, and complex input data which are embraced in a mechanistic learning framework.

	abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) play a vital role in revolutionising the healthcare industry, leading to more personalised, intelligent, and proactive healthcare. With the evolution of personalised healthcare, there is a significant need to represent a virtual replica for individuals to provide the right type of care in the right way and at the right time. Therefore, in this paper, we surveyed the concept of a personal digital twin (PDT) as an enhanced version of the DT with actionable insight capabilities. In particular, PDT can bring value to patients by enabling more accurate decision making and proper treatment selection and optimisation. Then, we explored the progression of PDT as a revolutionary technology in healthcare research and industry. However, although several research works have been performed for smart healthcare using DT, PDT is still at an early stage. Consequently, we believe that this work can be a step towards smart personalised healthcare industry by guiding the design of industrial personalised healthcare systems. Accordingly, we introduced a reference framework that empowers smart personalised healthcare using PDTs by bringing together existing advanced technologies (i.e., DT, blockchain, and AI). Then, we described some selected use cases, including the mitigation of COVID-19 contagion, COVID-19 survivor follow-up care, personalised COVID-19 medicine, personalised osteoporosis prevention, personalised cancer survivor follow-up care, and personalised nutrition. Finally, we identified further challenges to pave the PDT paradigm toward the smart personalised healthcare industry. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The increased application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in lung cancer treatment generates clinical need to reliably predict individual patients’ treatment outcomes. Methods: To bridge the prediction gap, we examine four different mathematical models in the form of ordinary differential equations, including a novel delayed response model. We rigorously evaluate their individual and combined predictive capabilities with regard to the patients’ progressive disease (PD) status through equal weighting of model-derived outcome probabilities. Results: Fitting the complete treatment course, the novel delayed response model (R2=0.938) outperformed the simplest model (R2=0.865). The model combination was able to reliably predict patient PD outcome with an overall accuracy of 77% (sensitivity = 70%, specificity = 81%), solely through calibration with primary tumor longest diameter measurements. It autonomously identified a subset of 51% of patients where predictions with an overall accuracy of 81% (sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 81%) can be achieved. All models significantly outperformed a fully data-driven machine learning-based approach. Implications:: These modeling approaches provide a dynamic baseline framework to support clinicians in treatment decisions by identifying different treatment outcome trajectories with already clinically available measurement data. Limitations and future directions: Conjoint application of the presented approach with other predictive tools and biomarkers, as well as further disease information (e.g. metastatic stage), could further enhance treatment outcome prediction. We believe the simple model formulations allow widespread adoption of the developed models to other cancer types. Similar models can easily be formulated for other treatment modalities. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Areas covered: This perspective paper provides an overview of the application of AI in the clinical management of IBD through a review of the currently available AI models that could be potential tools for prognosis, shared decision-making, and precision medicine. This overview covers models that measure treatment response based on statistical or machine-learning methods, or a combination of the two. We briefly discuss a computational model that allows integration of immune/biological system knowledge with mathematical modeling and also involves a ‘digital twin’, which allows measurement of temporal trends in mucosal inflammatory activity for predicting treatment response. A viewpoint on AI-enabled wearables and nearables and their use to improve IBD management is also included. Expert opinion: Although challenges regarding data quality, privacy, and security; ethical concerns; technical limitations; and regulatory barriers remain to be fully addressed, a growing body of evidence suggests a tremendous potential for integration of AI into daily clinical practice to enable precision medicine and shared decision-making. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Evaluating the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with stool-based service screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) beyond a randomized controlled trial is often intractable and understudied. We aim to estimate the proportion of overdiagnosis in population-based service screening programs for CRC with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The natural process of overdiagnosis-embedded disease was first built up to learn transition parameters that quantify the pathway of non-progressive and progressive screen-detected cases calibrated with sensitivity, while also taking competing mortality into account. The Markov algorithms were then developed for estimating these transition parameters based on Taiwan FIT service CRC screening data on 5,417,699 residents aged 50–69 years from 2004 to 2014. Following the digital twin design with the parallel universe structure for emulating the randomized controlled trial, the screened twin, mirroring the control group without screening, was virtually recreated by the application of the above-mentioned trained parameters to predict CRC cases containing overdiagnosis. The ratio of the predicted CRCs derived from the screened twin to the observed CRCs of the control group minus 1 was imputed to measure the extent of overdiagnosis. The extent of overdiagnosis for invasive CRCs resulting from FIT screening is 4.16% (95% CI: 2.61–5.78%). The corresponding figure is increased to 9.90% (95% CI: 8.41–11.42%) for including high grade dysplasia (HGD) and further inflated to 15.83% (95% CI: 15.23–16.46%) when the removal adenoma is considered. The modest proportion of overdiagnosis modelled by the digital twin method, dispensing with the randomized controlled trial design, suggests the harm done to population-based FIT service screening is negligible. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Digital twins enable simulation, comprehensive analysis and predictions, as virtual representations of physical systems. They are also finding increasing interest and application in the healthcare sector, with a particular focus on digital twins of the brain. We discuss how digital twins in neuroscience enable the modeling of brain functions and pathology as they offer an in-silico approach to studying the brain and illustrating the complex relationships between brain network dynamics and related functions. To showcase the capabilities of digital twinning in neuroscience we demonstrate how the impact of brain tumors on the brain’s physical structures and functioning can be modeled in relation to the philosophical concept of plasticity. Against this technically derived backdrop, which assumes that the brain’s nonlinear behavior toward improvement and repair can be modeled and predicted based on MRI data, we further explore the philosophical insights of Catherine Malabou. Malabou emphasizes the brain’s dual capacity for adaptive and destructive plasticity. We will discuss in how far Malabou’s ideas provide a more holistic theoretical framework for understanding how digital twins can model the brain’s response to injury and pathology, embracing Malabou’s concept of both adaptive and destructive plasticity which provides a framework to address such yet incomputable aspects of neuroscience and the sometimes seemingly unfavorable dynamics of neuroplasticity helping to bridge the gap between theoretical research and clinical practice.

	abstract = {Nutrition is a cross-cutting sector in medicine, with a huge impact on health, from cardiovascular disease to cancer. Employment of digital medicine in nutrition relies on digital twins: digital replicas of human physiology representing an emergent solution for prevention and treatment of many diseases. In this context, we have already developed a data-driven model of metabolism, called a “Personalized Metabolic Avatar” (PMA), using gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks for weight forecasting. However, putting a digital twin into production to make it available for users is a difficult task that as important as model building. Among the principal issues, changes to data sources, models and hyperparameters introduce room for error and overfitting and can lead to abrupt variations in computational time. In this study, we selected the best strategy for deployment in terms of predictive performance and computational time. Several models, such as the Transformer model, recursive neural networks (GRUs and long short-term memory networks) and the statistical SARIMAX model were tested on ten users. PMAs based on GRUs and LSTM showed optimal and stable predictive performances, with the lowest root mean squared errors (0.38 ± 0.16–0.39 ± 0.18) and acceptable computational times of the retraining phase (12.7 ± 1.42 s–13.5 ± 3.60 s) for a production environment. While the Transformer model did not bring a substantial improvement over RNNs in term of predictive performance, it increased the computational time for both forecasting and retraining by 40%. The SARIMAX model showed the worst performance in term of predictive performance, though it had the best computational time. For all the models considered, the extent of the data source was a negligible factor, and a threshold was established for the number of time points needed for a successful prediction. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The development of digital cancer twins relies on the capture of high-resolution representations of individual cancer patients throughout the course of their treatment. Our research aims to improve the detection of metastatic disease over time from structured radiology reports by exposing prediction models to historical information. We demonstrate that Natural language processing (NLP) can generate better weak labels for semi-supervised classification of computed tomography (CT) reports when it is exposed to consecutive reports through a patient's treatment history. Around 714,454 structured radiology reports from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center adhering to a standardized departmental structured template were used for model development with a subset of the reports included for validation. To develop the models, a subset of the reports was curated for ground-truth: 7,732 total reports in the lung metastases dataset from 867 individual patients; 2,777 reports in the liver metastases dataset from 315 patients; and 4,107 reports in the adrenal metastases dataset from 404 patients. We use NLP to extract and encode important features from the structured text reports, which are then used to develop, train, and validate models. Three models—a simple convolutional neural network (CNN), a CNN augmented with an attention layer, and a recurrent neural network (RNN)—were developed to classify the type of metastatic disease and validated against the ground truth labels. The models use features from consecutive structured text radiology reports of a patient to predict the presence of metastatic disease in the reports. A single-report model, previously developed to analyze one report instead of multiple past reports, is included and the results from all four models are compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model is used to label all 714,454 reports to generate metastases maps. Our results suggest that NLP models can extract cancer progression patterns from multiple consecutive reports and predict the presence of metastatic disease in multiple organs with higher performance when compared with a single-report-based prediction. It demonstrates a promising automated approach to label large numbers of radiology reports without involving human experts in a time- and cost-effective manner and enables tracking of cancer progression over time.

	abstract = {This article describes the preparation of a clinical study on a connected medical device dedicated to facilitate the prevention of lymphedema for patients treated for breast cancer after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and to alert them of any manifestation or resurgence in order to prevent its aggravation. A simulator of the entire physical process called digital twin has been developed for this purpose, in a hardware-in-the-loop framework. Statistical calibration of its input parameters, by stochastic inversion and using sensitivity studies, led to establish one or more measurement protocols allowing to capture the signal on a mobile device (phone or tablet) and to detect signal breaks that are physically significant. The measured signal makes it possible to report quickly on the worsening of the patient's condition and to warn the therapists within a very reasonable period of time. The general methodology of this work seems to us to be easily reproducible in the preparation of clinical studies of other types for connected devices, which aim to develop measurement protocols limiting the often significant cost of such studies. One of the immediate prospects of this work is the initiation of a clinical study on different patients who have been treated by surgery for breast cancer, after improving the robustness of the design of the prototype to take into account the uncertainties affecting the measurements.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For incurable diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the prevention of progression and the preservation of quality of life play a crucial role over the entire therapy period. In MS, patients tend to become ill at a younger age and are so variable in terms of their disease course that there is no standard therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to enable a therapy that is as personalized as possible and to respond promptly to any changes, whether with noticeable symptoms or symptomless. Here, measurable parameters of biological processes can be used, which provide good information with regard to prognostic and diagnostic aspects, disease activity and response to therapy, so-called biomarkers Increasing digitalization and the availability of easy-to-use devices and technology also enable healthcare professionals to use a new class of digital biomarkers—digital health technologies— to explain, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes. The technology and devices from which these digital biomarkers stem are quite broad, and range from wearables that collect patients’ activity during digitalized functional tests (e.g., the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test, dual-tasking performance and speech) to digitalized diagnostic procedures (e.g., optical coherence tomography) and software-supported magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. These technologies offer a timesav-ing way to collect valuable data on a regular basis over a long period of time, not only once or twice a year during patients’ routine visit at the clinic. Therefore, they lead to real-life data acquisition, closer patient monitoring and thus a patient dataset useful for precision medicine. Despite the great benefit of such increasing digitalization, for now, the path to implementing digital biomarkers is widely unknown or inconsistent. Challenges around validation, infrastructure, evidence generation, consistent data collection and analysis still persist. In this narrative review, we explore existing and future opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers in the care of people with MS, which may lead to a digital twin of the patient. To do this, we searched published papers for existing opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers for different functional systems in the context of MS, and also gathered perspectives on digital biomarkers under development or already existing as a research approach. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: The introduction of functional in-silico models, in addition to in-vivo tumor models, opens up new and unlimited possibilities in cancer research and drug development. The world's first digital twin of the A549 cell's electrophysiology in the human lung adenocarcinoma, unveiled in 2021, enables the investigation and evaluation of new research hypotheses about modulating the function of ion channels in the cell membrane, which are important for better understanding cancer development and progression, as well as for developing new drugs and predicting treatments. Main body: The developed A549 in-silico model allows virtual simulations of the cell’s rhythmic oscillation of the membrane potential, which can trigger the transition between cell cycle phases. It is able to predict the promotion or interruption of cell cycle progression provoked by targeted activation and inactivation of ion channels, resulting in abnormal hyper- or depolarization of the membrane potential, a potential key signal for the known cancer hallmarks. For example, model simulations of blockade of transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPC6), which are highly expressed during S-G2/M transition, result in a strong hyperpolarization of the cell’s membrane potential that can suppress or bypass the depolarization required for the S-G2/M transition, allowing for possible cell cycle arrest and inhibition of mitosis. All simulated research hypotheses could be verified by experimental studies. Short conclusion: Functional, non-phenomenological digital twins, ranging from single cells to cell–cell interactions to 3D tissue models, open new avenues for modern cancer research through "dry lab" approaches that optimally complement established in-vivo and in-vitro methods. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The present work aims to explore the performance of fuzzy system-based medical image processing for predicting the brain disease. The imaging mechanism of NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and the complexity of human brain tissues cause the brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images to present varying degrees of noise, weak boundaries, and artifacts. Hence, improvements are made over the fuzzy clustering algorithm. A brain image processing and brain disease diagnosis prediction model is designed based on improved fuzzy clustering and HPU-Net (Hybrid Pyramid U-Net Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation) to ensure the model safety performance. Brain MRI images collected from a Hospital, are employed in simulation experiments to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), FCM (Fuzzy C-Means), LDCFCM (Local Density Clustering Fuzzy C-Means), and AFCM (Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means) are included in simulation experiments for performance comparison. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has more nodes, lower energy consumption, and more stable changes than other models under the same conditions. Regarding the overall network performance, the proposed algorithm can complete the data transmission tasks the fastest, basically maintaining at about 4.5 s on average, which performs remarkably better than other models. A further prediction performance analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm provides the highest prediction accuracy for the Whole Tumor under DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient), reaching 0.936. Besides, its Jaccard coefficient is 0.845, proving its superior segmentation accuracy over other models. In a word, the proposed algorithm can provide higher accuracy, a more apparent denoising effect, and the best segmentation and recognition effect than other models while ensuring energy consumption. The results can provide an experimental basis for the feature recognition and predictive diagnosis of brain images. © Copyright © 2021 Hu, Zhong, Xie, Lv and Lv.},

	abstract = {A digital-twin (DT)-enabled Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system for telemedical simulation is developed, systematically integrated with mixed reality (MR), 5G cloud computing, and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to achieve remote lung cancer implementation. Patient-specific data from 90 lung cancer with pulmonary embolism (PE)-positive patients, with 1372 lung cancer control groups, were gathered from Qujing and Dehong, and then transmitted and preprocessed using 5G. A novel robust auxiliary classifier GAN (rAC-GAN)-based intelligent network is employed to facilitate lung cancer with the PE prediction model. To improve the accuracy and immersion during remote surgical implementation, a real-time operating room perspective from the perception layer with a surgical navigation image is projected to the surgeon's helmet in the application layer using the DT-based MR guide clue with 5G. The accuracies of the area under the curve (AUC) of our new intelligent IoMT system were 0.92 and 0.93. Furthermore, the pathogenic features learned from our rAC-GAN model are highly consistent with the statistical epidemiological results. The proposed intelligent IoMT system generates significant performance improvement to process substantial clinical data at cloud centers and shows a novel framework for remote medical data transfer and deep learning analytics for DT-based surgical implementation.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Thermal ablation is an exciting new minimally invasive treatment that destroys liver tumors without removing them. It uses image guidance to place a needle through the skin into a liver tumor, which is highly dependent on surgeons' experience. With the development of digital medicine, augmented reality (AR) has become a more intuitive and safer way to achieve real-time navigation. However, the technology is still in its infancy due to its limited accuracy and real-time performance. To address these problems, we syncretized the holographic AR with the digital twin technique to track the dynamic surgical scene and provide the 3-D navigation of heterogeneous target regions via internal motion prediction. To tackle the dilemma of real-time performance and precise internal motion estimation, a dynamic adaptation scheme is proposed to compensate for the time cost induced by the external/internal correlation model and data transmission. We carried out a series of experiments to validate our methods. With the proposed external/internal correlation model, the average estimation errors of the tumor and vessels are 2.18 and 2.79 mm, respectively. Besides, we performed in vivo experiments on two beagle dogs with an artificial lesion in their liver, respectively, and the puncture accuracy of our method are 2.5 and 2.17 mm. The results show that on one hand, our method can fulfill the real-time requirement of AR via using the intraoperative data, which is also more precise than that with preoperative data. On the other hand, our method can provide more 3-D information for surgeons, such as vessels, which can well ensure the safety of operation. © 2013 IEEE.},

The only way to optimize an intervention for an individual patient is to reframe their treatment as their own, personalized trial. Toward this goal, we formulate a computational framework for performing personalized trials that rely on four mathematical techniques. First, mathematical models that can be calibrated with patient-specific data to make accurate predictions of response. Second, digital twins built on these models capable of simulating the effects of interventions. Third, optimal control theory applied to the digital twins to optimize outcomes. Fourth, data assimilation to continually update and refine predictions in response to therapeutic interventions. In this perspective, we describe each of these techniques, quantify their “state of readiness”, and identify use cases for personalized clinical trials. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major world-wide health concern. Current diagnostic methods involve Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood tests, biopsies, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess cancer aggressiveness and guide treatment decisions. MRI aligns with in silico medicine, as patient-specific image biomarkers can be obtained, contributing towards the development of digital twins for clinical practice. This work presents a novel framework to create a personalized PCa model by integrating clinical MRI data, such as the prostate and tumour geometry, the initial distribution of cells and the vasculature, so a full representation of the whole prostate is obtained. On top of the personalized model construction, our approach simulates and predicts temporal tumour growth in the prostate through the Finite Element Method, coupling the dynamics of tumour growth and the transport of oxygen, and incorporating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition, our approach includes the simulation of the PSA dynamics, which allows to evaluate tumour growth through the PSA patient’s levels. To obtain the model parameters, a multi-objective optimization process is performed to adjust the best parameters for two patients simultaneously. This framework is validated by means of data from four patients with several MRI follow-ups. The diagnosis MRI allows the model creation and initialization, while subsequent MRI-based data provide additional information to validate computational predictions. The model predicts prostate and tumour volumes growth, along with serum PSA levels. This work represents a preliminary step towards the creation of digital twins for PCa patients, providing personalized insights into tumour growth.

	abstract = {Medicine itself is sick. We hardly understand any disease and therefore need to chronically treat symptoms but not the causes. Consequently, drugs and other therapies help only very few patients; yet we are pumping more and more money into our healthcare system without any added value.Thus, the internationally renowned physician researcher, Harald Schmidt, predicts the end of medicine as we know it. On a positive note, digitization will radically change healthcare and lead to one of the greatest socioeconomic revolutions of mankind. He is one of the pioneers of "systems medicine", a complete redefinition of what we actually call a "disease", how we organize medicine and how we use Big Data to heal rather than treat, to prevent rather than cure. In this book the author first proves the deep crisis of medicine, but describes how medicine will become more precise, more uniform, safer and, surprisingly, also more affordable. Making a diagnosis will be taken over by artificial intelligence. Current, mainly organ-based medical specialists, disciplines and hospital departments will disappear. Physicians will become patient coaches working in interdisciplinary teams with pharmacists, physiotherapists, nutritionists, etc. and relieved of their workload. Illnesses, including cancer, will be prevented or cured in a precise manner. We will become 100 years and older. Health care spending will shift from chronic treatment of diseases to prevention and health maintenance, thereby dramatically reducing overall costs. Health will become a common good. But Harald Schmidt also warns that those who are not open to digitization will not benefit from these advances and will be left behind. Anyone who wants to benefit from the revolution of medicine must have a digital twin. Is this futurism? No, each of us can have his or her personal genome sequenced, microbiome analyzed, keep an electronic health record. The future has begun. Schmidt convincingly explains the limitations in the current practice of medicine and the need for big data and a systems approach. Prof. Ferid Murad MD, PhD, Nobel Laureate in Medicine 1998, USA Network Medicine, a new discipline that offers a network-based understanding of the cell and disease, is unavoidable if we wish to translate the advances in genomics into cures. Professor Harald Schmidt, a prominent expert in this space, offers the first coherent treatment of the topic, explaining the potential of a network-based perspective of human disease.

	abstract = {The metaverse facilitates rapid and efficient decision-making by enabling connections with multiple experts simultaneously. This chapter discusses the metaverse’s contribution to healthcare solutions. This chapter covers the architecture of intelligent healthcare systems in the metaverse, projects, and real-time case studies related to disease prevention, prediction, treatment, post-care services, mental health support, personal care, elderly care, intensive care units (ICUs), telesurgery, medical education, and training. Furthermore, this chapter addresses ethical considerations, opportunities, limitations, challenges, and futuristic perspectives associated with these advancements. The arrival of digital reality has created a new digital world with apparently endless possibilities. AR (augmented reality), VR (virtual reality), and other digital technologies can help to reduce healthcare costs in several ways. Emerging technologies like the metaverse and multiverse are still in the early stages of development, but it has the potential to further revolutionize healthcare in several ways. The people can work, learn, and socialize in the metaverse, but they may need to travel less in the real world. This could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, as well as a reduction in air pollution in cities. The metaverse could be used to create virtual hospitals and clinics where patients could receive care from doctors and other healthcare professionals from all over the world. Three-dimensional Web3-based healthcare systems can provide patients with a more immersive and realistic experience. The chapters describe the architecture of a Web3-based metaverse healthcare system, focusing on data collection with the medical Internet of Things (MIoT), edge computing, artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), data standardization, and encryption. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world object or system. Digital twins can be used to simulate and test new procedures and treatments before they are used on real patients. This can help to improve the safety and efficacy of healthcare. The local network and public cloud can store and transmit patient data. This can help to improve the accessibility and scalability of the system. Another emerging technology called blockchain ensures data security and protection in Web3. Additionally, blockchain highlights various use cases including digital treatment of central nervous system diseases, cancer treatment, fetal medicine, and medical education applications. There are currently no regulatory guidelines for the metaverse, which can create uncertainty for healthcare providers and patients. It is important to protect users’ privacy and data security in the metaverse, including unauthorized access and cyberbullying. The metaverse has the potential to transform healthcare by improving access, reducing costs, and improving the quality of healthcare. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {We are unique and so are our diseases. Our genomes, disease histories, behavior, and lifestyles are all different. It is not too surprising, therefore, that we often respond differently to the drugs we receive. Cancer, in particular, is a complex and heterogeneous disease, originating in patients with different genomes, in cells with different epigenomes, formed and evolving on the basis of random processes, with the response to therapy not only depending on the individual cancer cell but also on many features of the patient. Selection of an optimal therapy will therefore require a deep molecular analysis comprising both the patient and their tumor (e.g., comprehensive molecular tumor analysis [CMTA]), and much better personalized prediction of response to possible therapies. Currently, we are at an inflection point in which advances in technology, decreases in the costs of sequencing and other molecular analyses, and increases in computing power are converging, forming the foundation to build a data-driven approach to personalized oncology. Here, we discuss the deep molecular characterization of individual tumors and patients as the basis of not only current precision oncology but also of computational models (‘digital twins’), forming the foundation of a truly personalized therapy selection of the future. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Their particularities lie in (i) their location in a highly functional organ that is difficult to access surgically, including for biopsy, and (ii) their rapid, anisotropic mode of extension, notably via the fiber bundles of the white matter, which further limits the possibilities of resection. The use of mathematical tools enables the development of numerical models representative of the oncotype, genotype, evolution, and therapeutic response of lesions. The significant development of digital technologies linked to high-resolution NMR exploration, coupled with the possibilities offered by AI, means that we can envisage the creation of digital twins of tumors and their host organs, thus reducing the use of physical sampling. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Anti-angiogenic (AA) treatments have received significant research interest due to the key role of angiogenesis in cancer progression. AA agents can have a strong effect on cancer regression, by blocking new vessels and reducing the density of the existing vasculature. Moreover, in a process termed vascular normalisation, AA drugs can improve the abnormal structure and function of the tumour vasculature, enhancing the delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumour site. Despite their promising potential, an improved understanding of AA treatments is necessary to optimise their administration as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer treatments. In this work we present an in silico multiscale cancer model which is used to systematically interrogate the role of individual mechanisms of action of AA drugs in tumour regression. Focus is placed on the reduction of vascular density and on vascular normalisation through a parametric study, which are considered either as monotherapies or in combination with conventional/ metronomic chemotherapy. The model is specified to data from a mammary carcinoma xenograft in immunodeficient mice, to enhance the physiological relevance of model predictions. Our results suggest that conventional chemotherapy might be more beneficial when combined with AA treatments, hindering tumour growth without causing excessive damage on healthy tissue. Notably, metronomic chemotherapy has shown significant potential in stopping tumour growth with minimal toxicity, even as a monotherapy. Our findings underpin the potential of our in silico framework for non-invasive and cost-effective evaluation of treatment strategies, which can enhance our understanding of combined therapeutic strategies and contribute towards improving cancer treatment management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The purpose is to explore the feature recognition, diagnosis, and forecasting performances of Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VMs) for brain image fusion Digital Twins (DTs). Both unlabeled and labeled data are used regarding many unlabeled data in brain images, and semi supervised support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Meantime, the AlexNet model is improved, and the brain images in real space are mapped to virtual space by using digital twins. Moreover, a diagnosis and prediction model of brain image fusion digital twins based on semi supervised SVM and improved AlexNet is constructed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the Brain Tumor Department of a Hospital are collected to test the performance of the constructed model through simulation experiments. Some state-of-art models are included for performance comparison: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Results demonstrate that the proposed model can provide a feature recognition and extraction accuracy of 92.52%, at least an improvement of 2.76% compared to other models. Its training lasts for about 100 s, and the test takes about 0.68 s. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the proposed model are 4.91 and 5.59%, respectively. Regarding the assessment indicators of brain image segmentation and fusion, the proposed model can provide a 79.55% Jaccard coefficient, a 90.43% Positive Predictive Value (PPV), a 73.09% Sensitivity, and a 75.58% Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), remarkably better than other models. Acceleration efficiency analysis suggests that the improved AlexNet model is suitable for processing massive brain image data with a higher speedup indicator. To sum up, the constructed model can provide high accuracy, good acceleration efficiency, and excellent segmentation and recognition performances while ensuring low errors, which can provide an experimental basis for brain image feature recognition and digital diagnosis. © Copyright © 2021 Wan, Dong, Yu, Lv and Lv.},

DT creates a virtual representation of a physical object reflecting its current state using real-time converted data. Nowadays, Women's health is more frequently impacted by cervical cancer, but early detection and rapid treatment are critical factors in the cure of cervical cancer. This paper proposes and implements an automated cervical cancer detection DT framework in healthcare. This framework is a valuable approach to enhance digital healthcare operations. In this proposed work, the SIPaKMeD dataset was used for multi-cell classification. There were 1013 images (Input size 224 × 224 × 3) in the collection, from which 4103 cells could be extracted. As a result, the CervixNet classifier model is developed using machine learning to detect cervical problems and diagnose cervical disease. Using pre-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs), CervixNet extracted 1172 features, and after that, 792 features were selected using an independent principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm. The implemented models achieved the highest accuracy for predicting cervical cancer using different algorithms. The collected information has shown that integrating DT with the healthcare industry will enhance healthcare procedures by integrating patients and medical staff in a scalable, intelligent, and comprehensive health ecosystem. Finally, the suggested method produces an impressive 98.91 % classification accuracy in all classes, especially for support vector machines (SVM). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Particularly in the medical field, machine learning-based models have outperformed physicians, exhibiting greater accuracy. Diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, dyslexia, skin diseases, and heart diseases have become focal points in medical research. Several deep learning methods, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), play crucial roles in disease prediction. This survey emphasizes the critical analysis of which deep learning models achieve higher accuracy in predicting specific diseases. The objective is to shed light on existing shortcomings in disease prediction and propose potential remedies for future improvements. Results indicate that Convolutional Neural Networks excel in predicting heart and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as breast cancer. Support Vector Machines demonstrate effectiveness in cancer prediction, while logistic regression proves adept at predicting dyslexia, and decision trees emerge as a favorable choice for skin diseases. Looking ahead, the integration of digital twins for predictive analytics, facilitating the simulation and modeling of disease progression based on individual patient characteristics, and leveraging blockchain for secure storage and sharing of health data represent promising avenues for future developments. © Authors.},

Digital twins (DTs) promise to revolutionize the field of mental health, as they are doing in other fields of science, including oncology and cardiology, where they have been successfully deployed. The use of DTs in mental health is yet to be explored. In this Perspective, we lay the conceptual foundations for mental health DTs (MHDT). An MHDT is a virtual representation of an individual’s mental states and processes. It is continually updated from data collected over the lifespan of the individual, and guides mental health professionals in diagnosing and treating patients based on mechanistic models and statistical and machine learning tools. The merits of MHDT are demonstrated through the example of the working alliance between the therapist and the patient, which is one of the most consistent mechanisms predicting treatment outcome.
